		the general structure is a multi body approach with preprocessing of goals.
		
		the preprocessing consist of clustering the goals to the agent.
			Randomization
		
		we assume that goals located near each 
		goal decomposition 
			subgoal independence
			adding goals for agents

	\subsection{Conflict Resolution}
		Since we're using multiple agents, each planning their own route, conflicts are bound to happen. We've chosen to rely on a method to resolve these, somewhat similar to online planning. But first and foremost, we need to describe exactly how we \emph{detect} these conflicts.

		\subsubsection{Detecting the Conflicts}
			Currently we rely on two different methods for detecting conflicts. The first method is simply letting the server \emph{tell} the client, that there is a conflict. This is by far the simplest possible way to detect a conflict, but it does inevitably result in a grater overhead. 

			The second approach is, that we employ a sort of double search. First we relax the domain, removing all other agents and boxes, that the current agent can not move. This results in a new subdomain, in which a search is performed. This results in a sort of threshold: In a perfect world, a solution for this problem exists in $X$ moves. This is then again used, to cut off the normal search, once it has taken too long. When this happens, we assume that it is because of a conflict. Using the route of the relaxed search, we identify which objects are in the way, causing this conflict.

		\subsubsection{Types of Conflicts}

			Having detected a conflict, we partition the causes into one of two groups: The cases where it is only a box in the way, and the cases where it is a box. As a rule, all boxes found in the route, is handled first. This is done to avoid cases, where an agent otherwise asked to move a box, is told to get out of the way. An example of this, can be seen below. $0$ is a \verb=BLUE= agent, and $1$ is a \verb=RED= agent. The box $B$ is also \verb=RED=. 
			\begin{verbatim}
				...+++++++++...
				     0 B1
				...+++++++++...
			\end{verbatim}
			In this example, $0$ would like to move right. Obviously, that is impossible, due to the fact that both the agent $1$ and the box $B$ is in the way. Should we chose to handle agents first, $1$ would move out of the way, leaving no one to move the box $1$.

		\subsubsection{Box Resolution}
			First we identify which agent is supposed to move any given box.  

			Agent close by not doing anything
