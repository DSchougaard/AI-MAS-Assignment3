%Has this been done before? What is the closest related research? How does your work difer? Related work is sometimes integrated into the introduction or background, and sometimes it is made a separate section towards the end of the paper. To make the related work section, you will be required to do some literature search to see if you can find papers that use similar methods (or combinations of methods) on similar types of problems. A piece of related work could for instance be if someone wrote a paper on using similar methods for the Sokoban domain. Sometimes it can be hard to find related work, but you should do your best. Use e.g. Google and Google Scholar (if a certain relevant paper is licensed, try to download it via findit.dtu.dk).
