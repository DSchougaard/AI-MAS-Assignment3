%What problem are you trying to solve? Why is this important? What are the main results/accomplishments/highlights of the paper. Since the reader is assumed to be familiar with the details and goal of the programming project, this section will probably be fairly short. But you can use it to briey describe the type of solution you have chosen and why.
\section{Introduction}
Inspired by the developments of robotics used for transporting assignments to lower the need for humans to carry out these trivial tasks.\\ This paper describes a solution to this planing problem on an abstract level, where the hardware of the physical robots have been disregarded and the environments have been relaxed in such a way that they make up grid like patterns. The  moving ententes which will henceforth be referred to as agents are given the ability to push and pull the objects henceforth refereed to as boxes around in the grid map, with the objective of moving these boxes to there destinations called goals, while navigation the obstacles in there way, be they walls, other agents or boxes they do not have the rights to move. By enforcing these rules and relaxations the resulting problem is of a single/multi agent pukoban nature. 
\subsection{The solution}
To solve the problem the level is first analysed mapping all agents, boxes, goals and walls, calculating distances from any cells to all other cells in the space, clustering the goals for the agents and then prioritizing them so that blocking goals can be avoided.\\
The agents run autonomously with no inter agent communication, the solution is sudo subgoal independent as an agent does not forget old goals when achieved, new ones are simply added to the list. To make sure that a route can always be found a relaxed search is run first and then an actual search. The planing is done on-line so conflicts are detected when the server objects this results in the invocation of conflict resolution.\\
If the case of a single agent problem a simpler strategy is used as all boxes are movable by the agent and no other agents can create road blocks no conflicts can occur.
