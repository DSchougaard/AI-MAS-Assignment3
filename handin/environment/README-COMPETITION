	- Download competition-levels.zip from CampusNet and unzip it, creating a complevels/ directory containing all competition levels. 
	- The usage of the cserver.jar is similar to server.jar. 
	- The -c switch is identical to that used in server.jar. The -d sets the directory of the competition levels (e.g. competition-levels/), and the competition server will run your client on every level in this directory. 
	
	- Assuming that cserver.jar and WinnerClient.class is in the parent directory of the directory complevels/. Executing the following in the directory of cserver.jar starts the competition server with WinnerClient.
		$ java -jar cserver.jar -d complevels/ -c "java client.WinnerClient"
	- In this example the string after the -c switch should be substituted for the command used to run your own client.

	- The competition server produces an output.out file containing logs and results generated by your client. You must upload this file (and only this file) to CampusNet, using the assignment "Competition Solutions". Please do not modify or rename the file.
