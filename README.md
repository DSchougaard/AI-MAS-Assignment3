# AI-MAS-Assignment3
The third and final project, for the 02285 Artificial Intelligence and Multi-Agent Systems.

## Description
The project, in all its simplicity, is about planning. More specifically the actions of so-called agents, to solve goals by proximity.

## Notes
offline/online planning?


independent agents (multi threading)

hericical approach

assume sub-goal independence

forward search
	best first search
	heuristic

negotiation
	highest workload = highest priority
	bidding for who solves the job
