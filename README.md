## Description
The project, in all its simplicity, is about planning. More specifically the actions of so-called agents, to solve goals by proximity.

## Notes
offline/online planning?


independent agents (multi threading)

hericical approach

assume sub-goal independence

forward search
	best first search
	heuristic

negotiation
	highest workload = highest priority
	bidding for who solves the job
	
	
## Tasks
Sub-goals
	Adjustable Resolution
	Goal state
	H: variable goal state

	Describe the problem
		2 search
			realistic
			relaxed
		DS: route
	Predict a problem

Conflict Resolution
	Agent
		msg : "Plz.move"
